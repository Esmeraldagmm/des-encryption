# This repository contains an implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, 
# a symmetric-key block cipher used for encrypting and decrypting data. The project includes:

## * A Python script (des.py) that performs DES encryption and decryption using various operations such as permutation, expansion, substitution, and key generation.
## * A Bash script (descheck.txt) that tests the functionality of the DES implementation by encrypting and decrypting a sample message and comparing the results with the output of OpenSSL's DES encryption.
